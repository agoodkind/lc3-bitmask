# lc3-bitmask
User input bitmask counter

This program counts the number of 1s in the value stored in R0 and stores the result in R1. 

For example, if R0 contains 0001001101110000 (x1370), then after the program executes, 
the value stored in R1 would be 0000000000000110 (decimal 6). 

this program also solicits a 2-digit input from the user that is used for the binary 1 count
